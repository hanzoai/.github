# Hanzo

Hanzo is a Techstars- and NVIDIA-backed applied AI Lab, AI Cloud, and AI Team building frontier models and scalable, open infrastructure for the intelligent economy.

We develop state-of-the-art LLMs, diffusion models, and agent systems — deployable anywhere, from GPU clusters to edge swarms.

Our unified AI Cloud powers the next generation of growth systems — from adtech, martech, and fintech to DeFi — all running on a secure, modular foundation built for real-world scale.

From deep research to real-time inference, Hanzo is building:

- ⚛️ **Zen** — Dual-mode Mixture-of-Experts LLM (Qwen3 + DeepSeek V3)  
- 🌀 **Koan** — Diffusion-first language model for multimodal generation  
- 🧠 **Enso** — Multimodal diffusion transformer (text, vision, audio, and beyond)  
- 🕊️ **Jin** — Predictive sensor learning for robotics, UAVs, and edge intelligence  
- 🌸 **Kensho** — 17B parameter image model for high-speed, photoreal generation  
- 🎞️ **Satori** — Efficient video diffusion with temporal dynamics  
- ✨ **AI SDK** — Your gateway to models, memory, and modular compute  

We build open systems to empower autonomous organizations, accelerate human-AI collaboration, and shape the next era of intelligence.
